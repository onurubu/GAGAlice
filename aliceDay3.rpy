#wake up
#she's been playing guitar the whole night on a guitar with old strings (missing a string). You feel sorry for her, but impressed at her drive.

#have an internal dialogue of how you are jealous, but at the same time, you've never even tried that hard, so maybe you don't even have the kenri to feel that way

#you decide to take her to a guitar store to buy new strings
#[here i think the bg music when she's practicing should be the song she's writing, but at various levels of playing: think wa2]
label:day3GuitarStore
#she's wowed by just how many types of guitars there are
#she find's a more pro-ish gutiar that she thinks really suits you (or that she really wants)
#maybe have a scene where you talk to the worker there (maybe he's a friend of the neighbour,  and the neighbour reccomended this place)
#you buy new strings and go back home
label:day3WayHome
#you end up becoming a little depressed and standoffish, but this time she asks you whats wrong
#you explain that you had always wanted to be creative but never had a spark, maybe waiting from a push from someone else

#you try apologize for how you acted yesterday
#choice as to whether to fully give into it or whether to take a step back
#She's on the verge of tears, and you take a step back

#jealous of how in a matter of hours, she got better than you were able to get (half-assedly), and so it makes you feel even more useless. 
#maybe i'm only trying to nurture your creativeness because I wish someone had done the same for me

#she gets upset: I only have a few days to live, yet you have years. I just want to try to find some sort of meaning while i'm here
#[i think try to maybe build that part of her character: in contrast to buttons attitude towards death, hers is more like: I want to be immortalized through creation]

#maybe this should go into day 2

#alice kind of represents the ego, with validation being a huge part of her character, and this results in her attitude towards death
#put this in earlier days too

label:day3Restring
#you tune up the guitar strings for her and are suprised by just how good she sounds
#she explains as a mushroom she has connection with ancient wisdom, and so for her it was very intuitive, 
#and she was able to learn super fast




#how is this different enough from the previous day?

#[how does she respond to the fact that today is her last day? How does she want to spend it with you?]
