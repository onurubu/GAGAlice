#It's very important that alice has fun making fun of mc, in a sadistic way, but almost like nagatoro

"You look over to your table, and pick up your phone"
"It's dead. Not like anyone ever messages you anyway." ## instead of focusing on him not getting messages, maybe focus on the fact that all he seems to do is waste time on those devices

m"What's the issue?"

ali"Whatever, do you want my help or not?" ## make her geuinely feeel a bit hesitant on continuing her usual method of interaction here. Any hesitancy will allow for the audience to not dislike her as much as they might want to

#maybe need to explain that although she's only a day old, she has instinct for only few things:
#Fashion/beauty, the need to be desired, knowledge on her species, as well as arts 
#(although the company programming tries to make her forget about that part) <- I dont think that you need to make it so the programming is trying to suppress the interest in arts. I think you can make her BECOME interested in arts through her experiences being alive
## For example, make her be fascinated at the concept of creating and being creative, and make that a natural progression for her rather than something she was born with
## Also the programming can be trying to get her "back on track" with that path
#maybe try to develop that motif a bit about like, her needing to fight her programming <- instead of needing, WANTING

ali"So how about you give me something to work with?"
ali"Makes it easier to at least know what we are going for"
m"I guess I like grey-scale stuff that's not too flashy" ## instead of grey-scale, maybe "calmer colours". He is wearing a blue hoodie so idk if grey-scale makes sense
ali"So what we came all this way so that you can keep trying to blend in with the shadows?"
ali"Come on, you must like at least some /real/ colors" ## Instead of "real colours" in response to my previous comment,maybe make her try to encourage him to wear something more exciting

na"Even cave paintings from thousands of years ago are going to be destroyed eventually"
na"Nothing lasts forever, and well..."
na"I like trying to make observations about what kind of people order from here, and try to make something just for them"
na"Art is like... How do I say it... Taking something abstract like, a thought, or a feeling... Sometimes just a funny vibe, or sometimes something really important"
na"The kind of stuff that inspires revolutions or changes lives"
na"It's a way of taking that message and trying your hardest to get someone else to feel the same way as you"

ali"I'm just too ugly, too annoying, too whatever"
ali"And that's not a great feeling"
ali"And for a while, I didn't really know what to do with myself"
ali"And being with you..."
ali"Was painful..."
ali"Do you know what it's like to be with someone you want to like you?"
ali"How painful it is to know that the reason they didn't like you isn't something you did"
ali"But just like... The way you are"
ali"And so I guess that's where I was for a while"

ali"And now I... I don't know"
ali"I feel like, maybe I can find something else worth living for"
ali"Even if it's only for another day"
ali"And I wouldn't have that without you"

mc"I didn't do anything special."
mc"I just said whatever words popped into my mind"
mc"Anyone could do that"

ali"Yeah, but you did"
mc"..."
mc"Whatever"
ali"So while we are talking like this... I was curious if there was anything you wanted to know about me"
mc"Like what kind of thing"
ali"I dunno? Like you know... My 3 sizes, the color of my underwear. You know, normal stuff"
mc"Who taught you what normal is?!"

show alice serious
ali"I guess I was just born knowing all kinds of stuff"
ali"Like ways to make people feel good, how to tie people up, that sort of stuff"
mc"WHY IS IT ALL SEX?!?!"

ali"Hmmm... Now that you mention it, a lot of it is related to sex"
mc"?"
ali"Like, I have some other information that I was just born knowing"
ali"Like uhhh.... I know a bit about mushrooms, and like... I guess some of the stuff is more abstract"
ali"Like when I was born I just KNEW that if I behaved a certain way, that you would like it"
ali"But it didn't go the way I assumed it would"
mc"So you mean like... You had like... Instincts about specific information? Like genetic memories?"
ali"I don't know what the fuck you're talking about but uh, yeah sure, why not"
mc"What I mean is, that you like woke up and knew how to speak perfect English, and all of that other stuff"
mc"I didn't really think about it too hard after the shock of ummm... You like... Being alive and everything"
ali"What you'd rather I was dead?"
mc"No I- Actually no, I'm not gunna take the bait this time"
ali"Awww, but it worked before"
mc"I was just trying to say that there needs to be a reason you know all of this stuff?"
ali"Yeah well... Didn't you like buy me off of the internet from some sketchy darkweb site or something" ## maybe a bit too referential.
mc"IT WASN'T THE DARKWEB"
mc"But yeah, I guess I wouldn't put it past that site to do something like that"
mc"I guess everything you knew makes sense for the purpose of what you were being sold for"
mc"So maybe they like, embedded that information into your DNA to streamline the user experience of ummm"
ali"I'm right here you know"
mc"Sorry, I phrased that sorta weird"
ali"I think you might be onto something though..."
ali"It is kind of weird that I know over 200 sex postions, but didn't know what a mall is huh?"
mc"There are that many?!"
ali"Way to reveal your power level wand master"
mc"I just think it's really fucked up"
mc"How they programmed you to be the ideal product for them to profit off of"
ali"Yeah, I guess... But..."
ali"Are you guys really all that different?"
mc"Huh?"
ali"I mean... Think about it right?"
ali"If you look around at every one here, they were all raised by parents, who taught them what was right and wrong"
ali"And then sent them to a school to learn stuff the government wants them to know for like a billion years"
ali"If you're born with one set of bits, you get given toys to simulate child rearing"
ali"And if you have the other, you're supposed to be like a firefighting astronaut football player or something"
mc"What were you watching on my computer last night?"
#Put in a bit in night of day 1 about her watching stuff on his computer because she's bored while he sleeps
ali"ANYWAYS! You know what I mean right... It's easy for you to point at me and say I'm fucked up, but from where I'm sitting"
ali"None of you guys seem that different"
mc"..."
ali"I guess I just wanted to know like... How do you know your values are you own?"
ali"Like are you living for yourself? Or to feel like you're winning in some game you've been conditioned to think is important"
#way too on the nose, rewrite to soften
mc"I... I don't-"
ali"Anyways, lets order some cake! After trying that coffee, I kind of want to see if the other stuff is any good"

ali"I kill the things around me"
ali"You know, they used to crush us up and mix us into milk to kill flies wanting to drink it"
ali"That's where the 'Fly' part of the name comes from"
ali"Isn't that weird if you think about it for a second?"
ali"If we are so scary, why would you mix it into the milk you drink?"
ali"I don't get it..."
ali"I don't understand anything"

mc"But... I think I read a study about like... Japanese squirrels? I think?"
mc"That were able to eat you guys. No problem..."
mc"And so... I guess I was just thinking like"
mc"Maybe it's not so black and white? That sure, maybe some people get the wrong idea, and think you're more of a threat than you really are"
mc"But at least me... I think you're not that scary."
mc"When we first met, I think maybe I was like what you said"
mc"You did kind of freak me out"
mc"But I sort of wasn't expecting the whole... You know? Living mushroom thing?"
mc"And everything else"
mc"So I'm sorry about that"
mc"But right now... I think you're just like any other girl"
mc"And I know maybe my opinion doesn't mean that much"

#Here is the original idea for the scene/ Feel like I didn't add everything I wanted to
#--------->
#choice whether to get her to open up adds a point to trust
#if trust is high enough
#she explains about her toxicity, and the danger she poses to those around her (people) in high doses
#at first she didn't have the tools to think about it, but she's starting to feel insecure about being perceived as dangerous

   #here its important to talk about her lifespan as a mushroom too, whether or not she's edible etc.
    #she discusses her view on death: i don't care about dying, as long as while i live i have some kind of meaning. I want to be loved.

    #[maybe she has some kind of internal conflict where she's afraid of getting close to people because she's literally poisonous]
    #but is it fine as long as she doesn't care about them? so she's scared of trusting someone, because her poison will hurt them
    #and push them away, so its easier she doesn't even try
    #or that she only uses them for sex, validation, then throws them away

#MAKE THE NAME OF THE EVENT SOMETHING FUNNY#

mc"Yeah, it's probably like a rock music thing from the vibes of the poster, and the little I can hear"
ali"Rock music?"
mc"Yeah it's like... I don't really get it, but I think it's a kind of music where people sing about like..."
mc"Being really angry at your ex-girlfriend..."
mc"Or like... Killing people? Or like... Maybe it's about dying yourself?"
mc"I don't know... I feel like I have lots of conflicting ideas about it"
mc"But either way, it's generally more intense music that deals with more heavy topics"
ali"That sounds kinda interesting"
ali"I feel like human's usually avoid interacting with the more ugly parts of being alive"
ali"But it sounds like some people go out of their way to think about it"
mc"Yeah. Some people like to escape from their problems, and others like to think about them all day"
mc"I guess human's are weird"
ali"I'm guessing that what you listen to is more in the 'escaping from life' catergory"

mc"I've heard a little bit of this sort of music"
mc"Through my bedroom wall"
ali"So your neighbour is into this sort of stuff"
mc"Yeah, I think he plays guitar too from the sound of it. He's pretty good too"
ali"So that means you have connections with an insider?"
mc"What? I don't even know what he looks like. So talking to him is out of the question"

#he's lying to his parents about it

#we can explore the impact and stress of needing to lie

#A huge part of why you're afraid to do stuff, make music, wear clothes, (be like your neighbour) is that you've always been given a hard time

#So i'm stuck between trying to pretend to be who they want, and trying to express who i am, and both of those aren't an option
