mc"So maybe they like, embedded that information into your DNA to streamline the user experience of ummm"
ali"I'm right here you know"
mc"Sorry, I phrased that sorta weird"
ali"I think you might be onto something though..."
ali"It is kind of weird that I know over 200 sex postions, but didn't know what a mall is huh?"
mc"There are that many?!"
ali"Way to reveal your power level wand master"
mc"I just think it's really fucked up"
mc"How they programmed you to be the ideal product for them to profit off of"
ali"Yeah, I guess... But..."
ali"Are you guys really all that different?"
mc"Huh?"
ali"I mean... Think about it right?"
ali"If you look around at every one here, they were all raised by parents, who taught them what was right and wrong"
ali"And then sent them to a school to learn stuff the government wants them to know for like a billion years"
ali"If you're born with one set of bits, you get given toys to simulate child rearing"
ali"And if you have the other, you're supposed to be like a firefighting astronaut football player or something"
mc"What were you watching on my computer last night?"
#Put in a bit in night of day 1 about her watching stuff on his computer because she's bored while he sleeps
ali"ANYWAYS! You know what I mean right... It's easy for you to point at me and say I'm fucked up, but from where I'm sitting"
ali"None of you guys seem that different"
mc"..."
ali"I guess I just wanted to know like... How do you know your values are you own?"
ali"Like are you living for yourself? Or to feel like you're winning in some game you've been conditioned to think is important"
#way too on the nose, rewrite to soften
mc"I... I don't-"
ali"Anyways, lets order some cake! After trying that coffee, I kind of want to see if the other stuff is any good"
mc"Uhh... Yeah..."

"After you paid the bill, you walked through the mall towards the exit"
mc"It's not too often I get to walk outside in the sunset"
ali"Yeah sure... 'in the sunset'"
mc"Yeah... Maybe I should do it more"
ali"Maybe you should! It's really pretty!"
mc"Why do you seem like you're having more fun on the embankment going back home, than when we were actually at the mall"
ali"The mall was fun... But this is nice too"

"You stop behind a still alice, crouching down on the grass."
"Her hand is outstretched but motionless, and a blue object lies on her extended index finger"
"A butterfly"
"The butterfly that moments ago fluttered about in the shallow breeze so freely"
"Laying peacefully still on her fingertip"
"..."
"..."
"The butterfly remains motionless"
"..."
"The moment stretches on for longer that you feel comfortable"
"You want to say something... Anything... But you feel like there's an unspoken weight in the air"
"You hear alice's taut vocal cords produce a strained sound as she exhales deeply"
"Not quite a voice, but still communicating to you a signal"
"Something's not right"
"She exhales again"
"This time the flow of breath carries with it a small whimper"
"You step closer towards her"
"And look more carefully at her hand"
"The butterfly remains transfixed"
"..."
"It reminds you of the preserved butterflies pinned up around your university department"
"Beautiful, yet devoid of life"
"And then you realize"
"The butterfly is dead"
"You look down at her face"
"Two wet streams trace her cheeks down to her chin as she bites her lip"
"Staring at the thing that used to be a butterfly"
mc"..."
"You don't know what to say"
"You think for a moment"
"'What's the matter... It's just a butterfly'... No..."
"'Why are you crying?'... You can't think of anything that doesn't sound insincere"
"..."
"You open your mouth in an attempt to muster up something to say"
ali"You know..."
mc"?!"
ali"When people see a mushroom with spots like me... What do you think they think?"
mc"Ummm... I uh... I think ummm like"
ali"Death... Toxicity... Poison... Hysteria"
ali"But you know... I'm not even that toxic"
ali"How many people do you think die from eating fly amanita?"
mc"..."
ali"NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS!"
ali"But still... That's what you all think of me"
ali"All anyone ever thinks about me"
ali"..."
ali"But you know... The worst part is..."
ali"Their fears aren't unwarranted"
ali"I kill the things around me"
ali"You know, they used to crush us up and mix us into milk to kill flies wanting to drink it"
ali"That's where the 'Fly' part of the name comes from"
ali"Isn't that weird if you think about it for a second?"
ali"If we are so scary, why would you mix it into the milk you drink?"
ali"I don't get it..."
ali"I don't understand anything"
ali"But I don't want to be something that causes suffering and death to everything around me"
ali"But that's how you all see me"
ali"By default"
ali"And there's nothing I can say that will change the way you all see me"
ali"I don't want to be like this!!!"
"Alice's voice slowly turns from words into incoherrent sobs"
mc"..."
mc"You know... ummm"
mc"I'm not going to pretend I know everything about you..."
mc"Or that I can talk for all human's or whatever"
mc"But... I think I read a study about like... Japanese squirrels? I think?"
mc"That were able to eat you guys. No problem..."
mc"And so... I guess I was just thinking like"
mc"Maybe it's not so black and white? That sure, maybe some people get the wrong idea, and think you're more of a threat than you really are"
mc"But at least me... I think you're not that scary."
mc"When we first met, I think maybe I was like what you said"
mc"You did kind of freak me out"
mc"But I sort of wasn't expecting the whole... You know? Living mushroom thing?"
mc"And everything else"
mc"So I'm sorry about that"
mc"But right now... I think you're just like any other girl"
mc"And I know maybe my opinion doesn't mean that much"
mc"But I guess I wanted to say if you're feeling isolated"
mc"I just wanted you to to know that..."
mc"You have me... and..."
mc" The squirrels I guess"
ali"..."
show alice smiling crying
ali"That's so... stupid!"
mc"I'm sorry..."
ali"And like... how would you know what a normal girl is like anyway"
mc"I-"
ali"Hahahaha"
mc"?"
ali"..."
ali"I'm sorry"
ali"I guess I got a little melodramatic"
mc"It's okay"
"She gets up and you keep starting walking again slowly"

##########################
#After you're done, you walk past a music store, filled with band posters

#Sees someone busking/band poster or something, she gets interested in music
#"oh yeah i've heard my neighbour play guitar before... I wonder if... nevermind..."
#her eyes light up and she begs for you to go speak to him
#taken aback by her out of charcter childishness

#i wanna give the impression of her pretentiousness is sort of her putting on airs, but she's really childish and innocent beneath that.

#choice
#you decide to try strike up a convo with him when you return back

#she's beaming and being a lot friendlier to you on the way back
#you listen to her ranting about what she's excited to try

label:day2WayHome
#on the way home you come across a butterfly, which ends up dropping dead after stopping on her finger
#her mood comes to a stand still
#she stops wanting to talk
#choice whether to get her to open up adds a point to trust
#if trust is high enough
#she explains about her toxicity, and the danger she poses to those around her (people) in high doses
#at first she didn't have the tools to think about it, but she's starting to feel insecure about being perceived as dangerous

   #here its important to talk about her lifespan as a mushroom too, whether or not she's edible etc.
    #she discusses her view on death: i don't care about dying, as long as while i live i have some kind of meaning. I want to be loved.

    #[maybe she has some kind of internal conflict where she's afraid of getting close to people because she's literally poisonous]
    #but is it fine as long as she doesn't care about them? so she's scared of trusting someone, because her poison will hurt them
    #and push them away, so its easier she doesn't even try
    #or that she only uses them for sex, validation, then throws them away


#arrive back, decide to let alice into your room first
#it's hard enough to meet someone new, let alone if i need to explain who alice is

#choice whether to get the courage to talk to neighbour
#how does alice respond if you don't do it

#how does mc deal with needing to concur the anxiety to knock.
label:Day2Neighbour
#neighbour comes to his door
#you're taken back by his clothing
#you can see inside his room is fulled with colorful posters, chokers, thighghighs, other stuff like that
#MC blushes slightly when talking to him due to being embarssed by the way he's dressed 
#you introduce yourself as his neighbour, all while feeling like its super awkward because its too late
#he beams and is excited to finally meet you

#"is this not a good time? I can maybe come back later if you're... busy"
#"no, I'm fine, I was just [doing something]"
#he's very unashamed and forthcoming about his interests
#You nervously being trying to ask
#he ends up getting over the toply worried expecting that you are going to tell him about someone being murdered on the floor or something
#his assumption about the situation is that something bad MUST have happened, because he's picking up how stressed you are

#when you clear the confusion and finally say that you heard him playing guitar and were wondering if you could borrow it for the weekend
#his expresion instantly brightens and he's super excited for you to try it
#YOU WANT TO START GUITAR?? WE SHOULD START A BAND! I know a bassist in my computer science class, we should totally jam sometime
#you try to play down his expectations because you're just a beginner, 
#he sees you looking at the band posters, and is excited that you  might be interested

#show his room as a reskin of mc room, but contrasts it 
#


#He asks you what kind of music you're into
#you know he's listened to stuff with screaming in it so you try your best to pretend like you know what you're talking about
#even though you've only every listened to lofi live streams, game osts, and anime intros
#choice of 3 genres to get different reactions from him
#if you say emo: he asks which bands, you answer MCR and stuff, because you had seen people online say that's emo
#he gives you a variation of the 'real emo" copy pasta as a response

#he offers to give you lessons
#you turn him down, but he loans you : 1 guitar, an amp (has headphone-in), a box of different sorts of picks, 3 live bluerays for his fav bands
#he apologizes that his spare guitar's strings are super old, but he needs his main gutiar for practice, and it's set to a weird tuning (and it's an 8 string)
label:day2GuitarSetup
#you waddle over back to your room after exhcanging discord accounts with him
    #where do we show this     

#alice is waiting inside and is super excited, but is trying to keep her composture (failing)
#you set it up for her and she starts messing around (not really knowing what to do)
#You've never been good at gutiar but your parents paid for lessons for you for a semester in highschool, but you never practiced, so they stopped paying
#you show her the very basics of low vs high string, and how to fret. show her an E minor chord
#it's a little out of tune, so you try to tune it up, and when you do the high e string snaps
#she's visibly disappointed, but is still eager to keep playing

#while she's messing around you get up and see your phone on your desk

label:day2PhoneCall
#missed call from dad, who saw account activity from where you went shopping
#he won't give you your own card and has a card on his account so he gets a text msg when ever you spend money, and can see where

#choice -> call back?
#if call back trust++

#call goes really badly, and dad is abusive
#"how's school going"lie
#"I saw you bought some clothes... from a women's store... I didn't raise you to be like this" etc

#maybe they've put him down for liking femme stuff before, and are concerned about it. so it's more of a "i thought we talked about this"

#[do you only show one side of it or skip dialogue or whole dialogue]
label:day2DeepTalk
#after call you talk to alice who's been messing around on guitar
#she's already started figuring out nice sounding chords you don't think you've ever played 
# you're a little overwhelmed by how quick she's learning

#at first she's like excited to share with you (in autism mode)
#at first mc is like "oh that's cool" but in a detatched and apathetic way
#she senses that she doesn't have his approval, so she gets moody
#mc gets defensive: Why are you angry, i literally didn't do anything

#You start to lash out at her

#contrast of how the 2 of them argue

#Alice: short and cold and precise when she's argueing, but when she's really hurt, will also do insults she doesn't mean. More petty. Tends to run away, when like this.
#MC:bottles up, tries not to express, but if he panics, he word vomits, with internal stuff leaking out. Sometimes he deflects and blames others. Focuses on what-ifs, over thinker.

#choice as to whether to fully give into it or whether to take a step back
#[I think all of the decisions need to be subtle, not GOOD CHOICE or BAD CHOICE]
#She's on the verge of tears, and you take a step back


#Explain that your relationship with your parents isn't ideal, and that they aren't proud of who you are but only when you 
#match the image of you they already have

#mc is masking that he's not doing anything: he's close to failing courses, tests grades aren't good
#he's lying to his parents about it

#we can explore the impact and stress of needing to lie

#A huge part of why you're afraid to do stuff, make music, wear clothes, (be like your neighbour) is that you've always been given a hard time
#just want to love myself, but every step i make towards that is met with pain
#So i'm stuck between trying to pretend to be who they want, and trying to express who i am, and both of those aren't an option
#maybe that's why I'm stuck in this small room, feeling like my life is on hold
#but time keeps moving, i keep aging, i can't stay in uni for ever, and I'm going to die one day
#and that's scary

#alice listens to what you have to say (how does she respond?)
#beware of just telling and not showing (try to be more subtle maybe?)

#FOCUS:You can't live for conditional love: pretending to be something you're not, when you only live one.

label:day2Evening
#how do you spend the rest of the evening? Watch the dvds from neighbour?

#maybe mc msgs neighbour on discord to say about string, he tells you about his friend working at a music store

#<- maybe the order here needs to change ->
#defuse by doing something together, show her music on youtube?  maybe you show her a little bit before, and then something after?
#You make a promise that tomorrow you would go to a music store and buy a new set of strings
